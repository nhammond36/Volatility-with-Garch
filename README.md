1 Abstract
How monetary policy impacts volatility of rates in the market for repurchase agreements also reveals
the Federal Reserve preference for volatility as it manages the policy rate, the Federal Funds rate (FFR)
within the target rate range specified by the FOMC. The Fed’s open market operations djust reserves
through repurchase transactions in the tri-party market to offset volatility in the Federal FUnds rate.
The Fed’s changes in the FFR, the target rate, and the administered rates, the interest on reserves
(IORB) and the overnight reverse repurchase rate (ONRRP) also impact money market rates in these
key funding markets. One puzzle is how the FFR survives the volatility of these short rates in the
Federal Reserve Bank management of the FFR within the FOMC’s target range
This paper describes the dynamics of these rates and proposes a model of volatility joint with monetary
policy. Comparing different policy regimes, we hope to elucidate the Fed’s preferences for volatility
in managing the FFR within ranges set by the FOMC. How that volatility may vary under different
monetary policy regimes may reveal the Fed’s preferences for offsetting volatility in managing the FFR
with the FOMC target
